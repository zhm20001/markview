//! G1, Tier 3 semantic oracle: the `<details>` scanner must agree with the
//! source it read.
//!
//! `html::details`, `html::close_tag` and `document::details_enclosing` turn
//! source bytes into a disclosure tree; a byte-level check can only ask
//! whether they stayed in bounds, not whether the tree means what the source
//! wrote. This target checks the meaning instead: the element the tree built
//! must enclose the tags the source wrote, and must not swallow a sibling.
//!
//! Oracle (O1, O2, O5), source-derived (plan item O7):
//!
//! - an element's range must start at its own `<details` byte;
//! - elements must be numbered once each, in document order, so two disclosures
//!   never share the identity a summary toggle addresses;
//! - a summary range must sit inside its element;
//! - the tree's declared `open` state must equal the source's `<details open>`;
//! - the summary text the tree reports must equal the source's `<summary>` inner
//!   text, modulo the Markdown the scanner is allowed to interpret;
//! - `details_enclosing` must return exactly the chain of elements the layout
//!   walk actually descends through.
