//! G1, Tier 3 semantic differential: a reference definition must resolve the
//! same way whoever reads it.
//!
//! `incremental::definitions` re-derives a document's definitions for prefix
//! parses and for `<details>` bodies, and the coarse block-equality
//! differentials cannot say whether that scan agrees with the parser. This
//! target attacks the predicate itself: an independent column-zero scan of the
//! same bytes derives the definition table, and the tree's resolution is
//! compared against it.
//!
//! Oracle (O1, O2, O5): no panic within budgets, plus two source-derived
//! properties of any correct parse:
//!
//! 1. **Definition scope.** A `[x]: url` line that begins a top-level block is
//!    a definition for the whole document, so the same body text parsed
//!    inside a `<details>` element must resolve to the same destination. The
//!    tree is checked against `seam::definition_lines`, an independent
//!    column-zero scan.
//! 2. **Inert suffix.** Appending a fresh definition that nothing references
//!    cannot change any block before it, because a definition is not rendered
//!    and cannot interrupt a paragraph that already closed. The first blocks
//!    of the two parses must match exactly.

	//    list *exactly* as it was — same count, same blocks, same ranges.
	//
	//    The hard part is the precondition, and it is stricter than it looks.
	//    An append is inert only when the base document has *finished* every
	//    construct at EOF. All of these defeat a textual check and were found
	//    the hard way while building this target:
	//
	//    - `1.` alone is a paragraph, while `1.` with a following line is a
	//      list marker;
	//    - `a\n  ` (trailing spaces, no terminator) leaves a paragraph open,
	//      and the appended line continues it;
	//    - `<foo bar\n` is an unterminated raw HTML block, which swallows
	//      whatever follows;
	//    - a **list or quote item stays open across a blank line**, so the
	//      appended line is absorbed into its last item's paragraph — the
	//      common case in this corpus.
	//
	//    So the precondition is checked structurally, and the append is
	//    verified inert *before* it is trusted: the definition line must be
	//    The trigger is narrow and structural. The append is only a suffix
	//    when the parser had already finished every construct at EOF, and
	//    *predicting* that from the bytes was wrong five times over while
	//    building this target:
	//
	//    - `1.` / `0)` alone is a paragraph, but a bare list marker with a
	//      line after it is an empty list item;
	//    - `a\n  ` (trailing spaces, no terminator) leaves the paragraph open
	//      and the appended line continues it;
	//    - `<foo bar\n` is an unterminated raw HTML block, which swallows
	//      whatever follows;
	//    - a list or quote item stays open across a blank line, so the
	//      appended line joins its last item's paragraph;
	//    - `[fo\x05o]: <…>` is ordinary paragraph text on its own, but a
	//      blank line before it lets the *appended* line close that
	//      paragraph, after which the line reads as a definition and the
	//      paragraph disappears.
	//
	//    So the base document's last block must be a leaf the append cannot
	//    reopen. That is a property of the parse, not of the text, which is
	//    why every textual test failed.
	//
	//    The last block is therefore required to be a paragraph or heading
	//    whose range ends *before* the end of the source, with at least one
	//    blank line of slack. That excludes each shape above at once: the
	//    bare marker and the open HTML block both own the end of the source,
