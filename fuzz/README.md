# Fuzzing harness for the Markview libraries

A `cargo-fuzz` + libFuzzer crate (nightly) covering the three library crates —
`markview-core`, `markview-pdf`, `markview-render`. This directory is its own
workspace and is deliberately **not** a member of the root workspace, so
`cargo test`/`cargo dist` at the root never see it.

## What the targets look for

A target is only worth a slot if it can fail for a reason other than a
segfault, so every one below carries an **oracle**: a property a correct
implementation must have, checked against the tree or the output. Tiers follow
the plan: T1 runs the property in an ordinary build, T2 adds ASAN, T3 compares
two readings — a fast path against a full one, a cache against a fresh engine,
a tree against an independent scan of the same bytes.

### G1 — parsing and document structure

- **`parse`** — looks for a panic, an overflow, a budget overrun, or a source
  range that is unordered or out of bounds. How: one input goes through the full
  parse, `assert_source_ranges`, the outline / `details_enclosing` / image
  walks, four prefix cuts, `parse_incremental` and `reparse`, all under one
  `InputGuard`.
- **`reparse`** — looks for the incremental fast path disagreeing with a full
  parse after a deterministic edit. How: both documents are fingerprinted
  *recursively* — every nested block's range and every inline's kind, style and
  range — so a shifted nested range is caught even when the rendered text is
  unchanged. A declined fast path is equal by construction, so the interesting
  inputs are the ones it accepts.
- **`prefix`** — looks for `parse_prefix` not being the opening of the full
  parse. How: six fixed and derived cut points per input; a prefix may truncate
  its last block, but no earlier block may differ and the last must stay the
  same construct.
- **`refdef`** — looks for a reference link resolving differently from what the
  source declares. How: an independent column-zero scan of the same bytes
  derives the definition table, and only two directions are asserted — a
  resolved link must have a definition carrying that destination, and an
  unresolved one must have no definition at all — so label *spelling* cannot
  fire it. A second differential appends a definition nothing references and
  demands every block before it stay identical.
- **`sourcepos_content`** — looks for a range that is ordered and in bounds yet
  still not a real place for the node that stores it. How: a containment walk
  (nested block inside its parent, inline inside its block, cell inline inside
  the table) plus "a block that reports reading text owns a non-empty range".
- **`details_structure`** — looks for the `<details>` tree disagreeing with the
  tags the source wrote. How: the disclosure chain is rebuilt from the tree and
  compared with `Document::details_enclosing`, and every element's declared
  `open` is checked against its own opener rather than a sibling's.

### G2–G5 — stylesheets, layout, text

- **`mvss`** — looks for a panic in stylesheet parsing or validation. How:
  `format_version`, the rule / font / page / svg / mermaid tables and the
  numeric, URL and digest checks, under budgets; a malformed sheet must return
  `Err`, never panic.
- **`layout`** — looks for a panic or non-finite, implausible geometry. How: the
  whole pipeline (line breaking, paragraphs, microtype, tables, scene) with
  every `Limits` budget driven toward its floor, and every produced geometry
  value checked finite and bounded.
- **`layout_diff`** — looks for the engine answering differently the second
  time, or a progressive layout disagreeing with a direct one. How: the same
  document is laid out twice by one engine and once by a fresh engine — all
  three snapshots must fingerprint equal, so a cache that changes the result is
  itself a finding. Syntax highlighting runs synchronously for these comparisons
  because the fingerprints include paint; background colors arriving between
  passes are an expected change. The document is then laid out progressively,
  with a prefix snapshot checked block by block (id, position, geometry) against
  the direct layout.
- **`math`** — looks for an uncaught panic, an overflow, or non-finite box
  geometry on the ratex path. How: `MathEngine::layout` under budgets, with a
  LaTeX-aware mutator keeping the corpus inside macro territory, where the
  expander's work accounting lives.
- **`highlight`** — looks for a panic in the syntax pass, reached the way the
  reader reaches it (a fenced code block inside a layout pass). How: the unit is
  `language \0 code`; the uncolored fallback is legal, and the detached worker
  gets its own allocation headroom.
- **`shaping`** — looks for non-finite advances or offsets. How: parley/swash
  shaping over arbitrary text and sizes, plus the stylesheet validation the
  shaper runs on install.
- **`fonts`** — looks for a panic in font validation. How: arbitrary bytes go
  through the byte-level checks and the directory scan the shaper performs; a
  malformed font must degrade to "not a font".

### G6–G7 — export and geometry

- **`pdf`** — looks for two exports of one input differing, or the exported
  bytes disagreeing structurally with the document they came from. How: export
  twice and compare bytes, then re-parse with `lopdf` and check page count,
  well-formedness, page geometry, per-page content, text round-trip and link
  destinations against the layout, pagination and geometry the export was given.
- **`geometry`** — looks for a renderer primitive returning a non-finite result
  from finite inputs (I7). How: the unit is an `arbitrary`-derived struct of raw
  `f32` bit patterns, and the checks cover intersection, corner/edge fitting and
  viewport transforms.

## How the oracles are built (`fuzzlib`)

- `allocator.rs` — a counting global allocator. **Declared once, here**
  (`#[global_allocator] pub static GLOBAL`); the [`budget::InputGuard`]
  reads the same instance, so the allocation gate is live. The guard
  meters a *per-input window peak*: `open_window` snapshots live bytes
  and resets the window high-water mark, so each input is judged on its
  own transient peak, never on the process-global peak (which an earlier
  larger input would otherwise mask). A zero allowance must panic — that
  is pinned by reverse unit tests (`cargo test -p mvfuzz`), including one
  where the input's peak stays below the historical global peak.
- `budget.rs` — per-input wall-clock and peak-allocation budgets. The
  allocation figure is the *window* peak of live bytes since the guard
  opened (see `allocator.rs`), so a budget-blowing input is caught even
  after a larger earlier input raised the global peak. The per-stage
  defaults (`Budget::parse/layout/pdf`) are calibrated from representative
  measurements — high percentile times a safety factor, plus a linear term
  when the peak grows with input length; `cargo run -p mvfuzz --bin calibrate`
  re-derives them. Campaigns override them via `MARKVIEW_FUZZ_TIME_MS`,
  `MARKVIEW_FUZZ_ALLOC_BASE_KB`, `MARKVIEW_FUZZ_ALLOC_KB_PER_KB` (B1) — no
  rebuild. Wall budgets carry a factor of two over the calibrated maximum so a
  descheduled small input in a parallel campaign does not read as a runaway; the
  layout allocation figure carries 2.5, because the detached highlight worker's
  tail can still allocate while the next input's guard is open. The wall budget
  detects *slow* inputs; a hung one is libFuzzer's `-timeout`'s job, since a
  post-hoc `finish` check cannot observe a hang.
- `pipeline.rs` — shared parse/layout plumbing. `warmup()` runs once per
  process before any layout-family input's guard starts: a fenced code
  block pays fontconfig's cold caches and the syntax-set build, and
  `prewarm_highlight` (a `fuzz`-only markview-core API) pays each
  syntax's one-time parse-state build, so none of that warm-up cost
  lands on an input's account. `export_pdf` supplies a synthetic one-pixel
  snapshot for every image the layout drew, so an input containing an image
  reaches the exporter instead of stopping at its "cannot embed image"
  precondition.
- `mutators.rs` — structure-aware markdown and MVSS mutators for the text
  targets (line-level edits of headings, lists, fences, tables, math
  delimiters), with a 1/4 fallback to libFuzzer's own mutation. `math()` is
  the LaTeX-shaped one, wired into the `math` target through
  `LLVMFuzzerCustomMutator`: it splices macro fragments
  (`MATH_MACRO_FRAGMENTS`), wraps and duplicates spans, and edits at TeX's own
  granularity, because the line-oriented markdown edits read as literal text
  to the expander. The `geometry` target instead takes an `arbitrary`-derived
  struct (F2): every field is an independent `f32` bit pattern.
- `oracle.rs` — finiteness/boundedness assertions, the layout snapshot
  fingerprint (three `DefaultHasher` passes over every geometry field;
  f32s hashed by bit pattern), and the deterministic input-hash helpers
  the targets share. `document` fingerprints the whole block tree —
  nested blocks' source ranges and every inline's kind, style and range —
  so a reparse that shifts a nested range is caught even when the reading
  text is unchanged. `assert_source_ranges` walks the document and demands
  every range be ordered and in bounds; `assert_prefix_consistent` is the
  `prefix` target's differential (a prefix may truncate its last block, but
  no earlier one may differ, and the last must stay the same construct).
  Character boundaries are deliberately not asserted: a `<details>` body and
  the blocks its closing block spills to the top level are parsed as
  snippets, so their ranges are snippet-relative by construction. Layout
  options **pin the committed test fonts** (`crates/markview-core/tests/fonts`),
  never the host's font set, so snapshots compare equal across machines.
- `seam.rs` — the structural differentials the `G1` Tier-3 targets share:
  source ranges against the text they address (`assert_rich_text_covered`
  and the containment walks), reference resolution against an independent
  scan of the same bytes (`assert_reference_resolution`), and the `<details>`
  tags the source wrote against the elements the tree built
  (`details_elements`, `declared_open`). They need no second implementation,
  only an input whose two readings disagree.
- `pdf_oracle.rs` — the `pdf` target's structural readback: the exported
  bytes are re-parsed and checked against the layout, pagination and geometry
  the export was given (page count, well-formedness, page geometry, per-page
  content, text round-trip, link destinations). The text check is a multiset
  over the code points the pinned faces can draw, and it excludes the
  character after an undrawable glyph, because `lopdf`'s `/ToUnicode` decoder
  matches greedily without consulting `codespacerange` — an extractor limit,
  not an export defect.
- `ratex.rs` — the `\char` overflow allowance. `ratex-parser` 0.1.14
  accumulates the argument without a width check, and `libfuzzer-sys` aborts
  on the panic before the `catch_unwind` in `markview-core` can absorb it, so
  the four targets that reach ratex call `allow_char_overflow()`, which swaps
  that one hook for a non-aborting one. Every other panic still aborts, so the
  oracle stays strict.
- `probe.rs` — `measure`/`Measured`, so a one-off probe reports the same
  window-peak allocation `budget::InputGuard` meters; used by
  `bin/mathprobe` and `bin/warmcheck`.

## Building and running

```sh
cd fuzz
cargo +nightly fuzz build                       # ASAN (T2), every target
cargo +nightly fuzz build parse                 # one target
cargo +nightly fuzz run parse -- -runs=5000     # brief smoke
```

Formatting: `cargo +nightly fmt -p markview-fuzz -p mvfuzz` inside
`fuzz/`. A bare `cargo fmt --all` here climbs to the *root* workspace and
reformats the app with the wrong toolchain, so keep the root on stable
(`cargo fmt --all` at the root) and the harness on nightly, and never
cross-format.

Seeds (C1–C4): `fuzz/scripts/prepare_seeds.sh` downloads the CommonMark
spec examples (652), the GFM spec examples (648 of 672; the missing ones
nest fenced code inside the example block), KaTeX test-suite LaTeX (764),
and the built-in MVSS stylesheets into `fuzz/corpus/{parse,math,mvss}/`.
The script needs network access; corpora are gitignored and rebuilt on
demand.

## Adding an oracle

1. Name the property a correct implementation must have, and the reading it
   can be falsified against. Prefer a second, independent reading (a scan of
   the source, a fresh engine, a re-parse of the output) over a restatement of
   the code under test; a differential that mirrors the implementation only
   tests itself.
2. Decide what may legally vary. Every oracle here needs a documented escape
   hatch — a declined fast path, an uncolored fallback, a snippet-relative
   range — or it will be red from the first corpus replay and bury anything
   new.
3. Register the target in `Cargo.toml`, describe it in the table above, and run
   `fuzz/scripts/guard.sh --full` before spending a campaign on it.

## Campaigns

A campaign is a run of one target long enough to stop finding new coverage. A
record is a requirement, not an option, and it holds:

- **command** (target, flags, `-runs`), **build** (commit plus how the binaries
  were produced), **wall clock** and **CPU time** (the libFuzzer exit
  summary), **ASAN on/off**, and the **seed-corpus state** (what
  `prepare_seeds.sh` produced).
- Known environment: fontconfig's C library keeps charset caches until process
  exit, so campaigns run with `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0`, and a
  `LeakSanitizer` report on that cache is not a regression.
- Corpus and campaign records are generated artifacts and stay outside version
  control. libFuzzer also drops `crash-*`/`leak-*` files in the crate root when
  a run dies; move them out of the tree before the next run.
- A found bug's path: minimize it, seed the minimized input into the corpus
  (and, for a library bug, add a regression test in the crate), and attribute it
  (markview vs comrak vs another upstream). An input that only trips an oracle
  needs the same attribution before it is worth a record.

`fuzz/scripts/` carries the slot allocator and the drivers a long campaign runs
through:

- `slot.sh` — eight flock-protected slots, one per P-core logical CPU,
  `taskset`-pinned and RSS-capped through `rsscap.sh`. `--list`, `--wait`
  (block for a slot), `--try` (run only if one is free); `FUZZ_SLOT_DIR` moves
  the lock directory.
- `rsscap.sh` — an RSS watchdog for the command it wraps: a process that grows
  past the limit is killed, so a runaway fuzzer dies instead of taking the
  machine down. A virtual-address cap (`ulimit -v`) is **not** usable here:
  ASAN reserves terabytes of shadow address space, so a sanitized binary would
  abort before `main`.
- `campaign.sh <target> <seconds>` — one bounded run: slot, pin, RSS ceiling,
  libFuzzer flags, and a self-contained record (command line, binary mtime,
  corpus state, exit summary, peak RSS) written next to the run's log. The
  record root is `out` at the top of the script. Fuzzing runs in fork mode with
  `-keep_seed`, so a crash libFuzzer reports mid-block does not end it and the
  block still honours `-max_total_time` on an accumulated corpus.
- `campaign-supervisor.sh <hours>` — a fill loop that keeps every slot busy
  from a priority-ordered rotation for the given window, then drains.
- `guard.sh` — `cargo check -p mvfuzz` before a campaign starts (`--full` adds
  every target), so a broken shared library cannot waste a slot.
