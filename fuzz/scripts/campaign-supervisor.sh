# The Lead runs this for the overnight window. It is a *fill* loop, not a
# scheduler: each tick it counts the free slots, starts exactly that many
# blocks, and returns. Blocks go through `campaign.sh`, so pinning, the RSS
# ceiling and the per-run record are identical to a hand-started run.
#
# Steady state never exceeds the eight slots, which is the user's stated
# budget: at most eight threads, pinned to the P-cores. Builds and triage are
# transient and are not started from here.
#
# `slot.sh --try` is the allocation primitive: it exits 75 when no slot is
# free and otherwise runs the command in the slot it claimed. Counting free
# slots first keeps this loop from queueing work on top of a running block.
