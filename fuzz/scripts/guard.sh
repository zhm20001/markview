# half-finished signature anywhere under `fuzz/fuzzlib` stops *the whole
# team's* builds — not just the author's. That happened three times in the
# first forty minutes of the overnight campaign and cost roughly forty
# minutes of wall clock each time, because the author was mid-edit and the
# other three had to discover the break independently.

#   guard.sh --full   check the lib and every registered target
#
# Intended to be run before parking a task, before a long fuzz block, and by
# any loop that edits `fuzz/fuzzlib`.
