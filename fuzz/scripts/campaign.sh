# A crash this target has already produced must not end the run: the campaign
# is looking for something new, and libFuzzer re-derives known inputs fast.
# `-ignore_crashes` and `-ignore_ooms` only take effect in fork mode, so
# `-fork` is not optional here: without it the first known crash ends the
# block. One worker is enough to fill the single pinned slot.
#
# `-keep_seed` skips fork mode's initial set-cover merge, which runs before
# libFuzzer looks at `-max_total_time`: the accumulated `parse` corpus
# (229k units) made a 5 s block run 18 minutes without it, while the same
# block exits in 5.6 s with it.
#
# `-timeout` must clear the target's one-time warm-up, which libFuzzer counts
# as an input: the three targets that call `pipeline::warmup` pay 45-75 s on a
# pinned P-core *before* the first fuzz iteration, and a hard-coded 30 s
# timeout fails on an idle machine. WARMUP_SECS states the target's real cost
# in seconds; the default 90 covers the measured 75 s maximum, and the timeout
# is three times it plus a minute so a descheduled process does not read as a
# hang.
