# Development guide

This page is for contributors changing Markview. It is procedural: the design rationale is in [architecture](architecture.md), and the MVSS format is in [the stylesheet guide](stylesheets.md).

## Build and verify

Use the locked workspace commands from the repository root:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --locked
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo build --release --locked
```

Debian and Ubuntu additionally need the native development packages:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1-dev libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev
```

Automated tests use the committed subsets in `crates/markview-core/tests/fonts`
with system fonts disabled, including SVG, Mermaid and GPU tests. Running the
reader itself needs fonts covering Latin and CJK, such as `fonts-noto-core` and
`fonts-noto-cjk`. Regenerate subsets with `scripts/generate_test_fonts.py` when
adding characters or faces; that step requires the source Noto fonts and
Python `fontTools`.

On Linux, CI uses `tests/fontconfig.conf` to hide all installed fonts. Reproduce
that check with `FONTCONFIG_FILE="$PWD/tests/fontconfig.conf" cargo test --workspace --all-targets --locked`.

Release archives, installers, and the platform icons are maintained separately;
see the [packaging guide](packaging.md). After changing `assets/markview-icon-color.svg`:

```sh
cargo run -p xtask -- icons
```

For visual or timing changes, also use the real pipelines:

```sh
target/release/markview render examples/welcome.md --output artifacts/welcome.png
target/release/markview render examples/mermaid.md --output artifacts/mermaid.png
target/release/markview pdf examples/welcome.md --output artifacts/welcome.pdf
target/release/markview smoke-test examples/welcome.md --output artifacts/window.png
target/release/markview bench tests/fixtures/ordinary-10k.md --output artifacts/ordinary.json
target/release/markview latency tests/fixtures/ordinary-10k.md --output artifacts/latency.json
python3 scripts/smoke_watch.py target/release/markview
```

the `pdf` subcommand writes the paper edition: the document is laid out again at the page's
text measure, broken into pages, and written as vector text with subset fonts.
Check an export in a viewer (`pdftotext`, `pdfinfo`, `qpdf --qdf`) for page
count, page furniture, link annotations, text selection and embedded fonts.
A block that had to shrink to fit the page, or a band taller than the page, is
reported on stderr. The export never depends on the GPU, so it runs headless.
Add `--watch` to iterate on a document: the session rebuilds the PDF on every
save, reusing the unchanged parse, layout and images, and logs how many blocks
each rebuild reused.

The GPU renderer and the PDF writer share the layout and the `print` sheet, so
the same document at the same measure must place the same content in the same
place. `scripts/compare_pdf_render.py` holds them to that: it exports one
fixture both ways, rasterizes the PDF page with Ghostscript, and reports each
content band's best alignment, profile overlap, ink ratio and a windowed SSIM,
then fails on a shift, a missing band, or a low overlap. It needs python3 with
numpy and Pillow, plus `gs`:

```sh
python3 scripts/compare_pdf_render.py examples/welcome.md --out /tmp/pdf-cmp
```

At the default two device pixels per layout pixel the two images overlap by
86–97% per band with no shift; the remaining difference is glyph rasterization
weight, because the GPU bakes subpixel coverage into bitmaps while Ghostscript
antialiases vector outlines. `--out` keeps a side-by-side image and a diff heat
map for eyeballing.

`latency` measures the two latency targets and the reload memory trend
through the real layout worker and prefix publication: process entry to the
first readable GPU frame, a small on-disk edit to the first refreshed frame and
to the complete re-layout, and per-edit RSS. Aggregate independent processes
with `python3 scripts/bench_latency.py`. The shipped large fixtures repeat
paragraph bodies, which flatters any content-keyed cache; generate
unique-content and cache-stressing fixtures with
`python3 scripts/generate_stress_fixtures.py` before drawing scaling
conclusions. First-frame samples are noisy across processes, so alternate the
baseline and candidate binaries rather than running one set after the other.
The [latency and memory analysis](performance-analysis.md) records
the baseline those commands produced.

The README screenshots are reproducible on a KDE/Wayland desktop. They show the
real window, so the capture asks Spectacle for the active window and then crops
it to the window frame:

```sh
scripts/capture_screenshots.sh                 # every image
scripts/capture_screenshots.sh en-typography   # one image
```

Their sources are under `docs/screenshots/source/`. The latency and memory
figure is drawn from the baselines in [the performance model](performance.md):

```sh
python3 scripts/generate_readme_charts.py
```

`scripts/generate_large_fixture.py` writes 100 KiB `math-cjk-100k.md` and
`text-cjk-100k.md` fixtures for large-document timing. Set `MARKVIEW_PROFILE=1`
when running `bench` to add inclusive per-sub-stage layout timings to the
report under `profile_ms`; leave it unset for production-comparable numbers,
because the probes add roughly 5 % to layout.

`tests/fixtures/emoji-fallback.md` exercises bold check/cross Emoji, keycaps,
headings, emphasis and mixed scripts. Include it in cold-process comparisons:
warm reflows alone hide font fallback initialization costs. For a stage breakdown:

```sh
MARKVIEW_PROFILE=1 target/release/markview bench tests/fixtures/emoji-fallback.md --iterations 3 --output artifacts/emoji-profile.json
```

`layout.font_resolve_ms` measures configured candidate resolution/loading;
`layout.font_choose_ms` measures cluster coverage selection and fallback warnings;
`layout.shape_build_ms` measures Parley's build, including its own font fallback
and shaping. These are inclusive diagnostic spans, not additive pipeline stages.
Render this fixture in both themes as well as measuring it. Default Emoji
candidates explicitly use weight 400 because many Emoji fonts have no bold face.

The bundled Emoji definitions set `emoji = true`, so a cluster Unicode presents
as Emoji (`Emoji_Presentation`, or a `U+FE0F` selector) takes that face even when
a text candidate covers it too. The pinned test fonts reproduce the case: the
Noto Serif and Noto Sans CJK subsets both hold U+26A0, so `⚠️` must resolve to
Noto Color Emoji while `⚠` stays with the CJK face. `U+FE0E` keeps the text
presentation. The classification follows Unicode defaults, so bare warning
signs, hearts, © and ™ stay with the reading font; if no text candidate covers
one of those, the Emoji face is still the last resort.

When no configured face covers a cluster/word, a `WARN` line on stderr reports its
Unicode codes, requested candidates and available faces before handing it to
Parley. Normal selection of a later configured candidate is silent. Warnings are
limited to one per candidate set (including requested weight), at most 64 per text
shaper, and survive reflow/stylesheet resets. Internal object placeholders are
excluded. To exercise warnings, use a temporary custom style with unavailable font
families and a character those fonts cannot draw; verify repeated reflows stay
quiet.

The reader and the core crate log through the `log` facade, and the binary writes
`LEVEL message` lines to stderr. A plain window run defaults to `warn`, so the
lifecycle and timing lines stay quiet; `render`, `bench` and `smoke-test`
default their own targets to `debug` so the diagnostics below are visible. Set
`RUST_LOG` to override either, for example `RUST_LOG=info` for the display metrics
or `RUST_LOG=debug` to include dependency logs.

The render and benchmark modes use the GPU offscreen and do not load personal settings. The watch smoke test writes only temporary documents and closes the window it starts.

Window layout publishes a readable prefix before completion. Native `smoke-test`
logs `process entry→readable GPU frame` (true process entry) and
`process app entry→readable GPU frame` (after command-line and stylesheet setup)
for that first frame and `full layout complete` separately, then waits for the
complete snapshot to render before exiting. Its PNG captures the first readable
frame. Offscreen `bench` and `render` continue to use complete geometry;
their timings must not be reported as progressive window first-frame timings.

Ignored GPU tests are useful for settings, selection, and image-frame regressions:

```sh
cargo test --workspace --locked button_feedback_frames -- --ignored
cargo test --workspace --locked redesigned_chrome_frames -- --ignored
cargo test --workspace --locked settings_and_selection_frame -- --ignored
cargo test --workspace --locked outline_drawer_frames -- --ignored
cargo test --workspace --locked tab_strip_frames_clip_overflow_at_fractional_dpi -- --ignored
cargo test --workspace --locked gpu_frame_draws_decoded_images -- --ignored
cargo test --workspace --locked color_glyphs_preserve_rgb_and_share_paint_order -- --ignored
```

The redesigned chrome matrix writes `artifacts/ui-redesign/` frames for both
palettes, 500×300, 820×600 and 1200×800 windows, and 1×, 1.25× and 2× form
rendering. Inspect the settings and export clips, fixed footers, focus outlines,
stylesheet list, empty/loading/error states, image notice and confirmation.
Button state sheets in `artifacts/ui-feedback/` compare resting, hover, pressed,
keyboard focus and disabled states at the same scales. Pointer activation occurs
on a matching release; keyboard navigation alone displays the focus outline.
Shared form geometry supplies unclipped controls for keyboard navigation and
clipped controls for pointer input; Tab reveals the focused control. Closing a
panel resets its position on the next open, while a stylesheet round trip keeps
the parent form's scroll position. Settings' eye control fades the form to 25%
opacity without dimming the document; its exit icon stays opaque. Preview is
transient and resets when settings reopen. The toolbar remains drawn behind
all panels. UI colors remain MVSS rules under `ui`;
document and print typography are independent.

## Choose the layer

1. Put Markdown meaning, reading text, geometry, hit testing, and selection mapping in `crates/markview-core`.
2. Put the pointer-driven selection machine, which holds no reading text and no events of its own, in `crates/markview-selection`.
3. Put GPU resources, clipping, rasterization, and frame assembly in `crates/markview-render`.
4. Put files, settings, watching, image I/O, platform effects, commands, and window interaction in the root crate.

Keep core free of window, GPU, clipboard, filesystem, and configuration dependencies. Prefer immutable snapshots and explicit version tags at asynchronous boundaries. Reuse the retained `Document` when only layout settings change.

## Change a feature

For a font filter or row action, edit `src/app/font_panel/mod.rs` and its
`view.rs`; the root command routes the feature as one category and chrome
borrows its display model. Add a behavior test there for the filtered row's
identity, cancellation or progress. Shared button and list geometry stays in
`app/chrome`. Change panel navigation through `InteractionState` operations,
keeping the outline and confirmations independent.

For PDF options, update `export::PdfRequest` only when the service needs new
information, then adapt CLI parsing and/or the GUI request builder. Keep
entry-point defaults explicit and test the resulting request and export.
Transport policy belongs in `net`; image caching and font installation stay
with their respective services.

## Add a UI icon

1. Put a square, geometry-only SVG in `assets/ui`. Its colors are ignored: the button's theme color paints it, stroked figures are drawn round-capped, and a filled figure must set `fill` on the element. Keep `width`, `height` and `viewBox` consistent so the stroke weight normalizes correctly.
2. Add a constant to `src/app/chrome/icons.rs`, such as `pub(super) const SAVE: &[IconPath] = markview_icon::icon!("assets/ui/save.svg");`. The macro parses the file at compile time into a unit-box buffer and registers it for rebuild tracking, so no SVG parser reaches the binary.
3. Set `icon: Some(...)` on the button's `Button` literal. The chrome centers it with `button_icon` in place of the label.
4. Keep the button's `label` even when it draws an icon; tests and hit testing use it as the button's name.

## Add a document node

Use this sequence when adding a Markdown or HTML construct:

1. Identify the semantic input and its intended reading-text and copy behavior. Do not begin with a renderer primitive.
2. Extend `BlockKind`, `InlineKind`, or the relevant style data in `crates/markview-core/src/document.rs` (and `html.rs` for supported raw HTML).
3. Parse the construct into that semantic representation, preserving a source range and stable reading order. Keep unsupported syntax as literal text rather than silently dropping it.
4. Add layout behavior in `layout.rs`. Decide whether the node is text, a block, or an atomic inline box; produce text nodes and geometry together so hit testing and copying use the same mapping.
5. Add only the semantic paint instructions needed by the renderer. Do not make the renderer reinterpret Markdown.
6. Add a stylesheet condition only if the node has a visual role that no existing condition expresses. Validate it through the same MVSS parser as bundled and user styles.
7. Add focused unit tests for parsing, source ranges, reading text, selection/copying, layout, and cache identity. Add a renderer test only for GPU-specific behavior.
8. Add a fixture or example when the feature is difficult to understand visually, then run the full workspace checks.

Common mistakes are treating source offsets as persistent identity, putting display-only text into copied reading text, using glyphs as the selection model, and creating a second layout path for a special inline object. These produce subtle bugs in reflow, repeated blocks, CJK selection, and asynchronous reloads.

## Change asynchronous behavior safely

When a worker or loader changes, test stale-result rejection, replacement of pending requests, failed reads, and versioned image completion. Preserve the last valid snapshot on recoverable errors. When a change affects only colors or interaction overlays, avoid invalidating geometry; when it affects fonts, width, spacing, or intrinsic asset size, invalidate the relevant layout.

## Keep documentation maintainable

Document guarantees and reasons in architecture pages, procedures and examples in guides, and measured facts in the performance page. Remove a stale statement instead of adding a contradictory exception. Link to the owning page rather than copying the same rule into several documents.

## Refactor with a preserved baseline

Before changing a performance-sensitive path, build the current release and copy
its binary outside `target/release`. Keep its source revision with it. After the
change, build the candidate with the same lockfile, toolchain and release profile.
Compare the preserved and candidate binaries on the same machine with hardware
GPU access, under the same power mode and operating conditions. Battery power
and `power-saver` are valid for regression checks; AC power and the `performance`
profile are not prerequisites. Alternate the binaries across repeated process
groups, keeping power mode, CPU affinity, fonts, DPI and driver consistent.
Avoid competing workloads and record changes in thermal or power conditions.
On this host, `power-saver` slowed both binaries by 1.6–2×, which illustrates why
current results must be compared with a contemporaneous baseline rather than
historical absolute timings. Power mode alone neither establishes nor excuses
a regression; investigate differences using paired measurements and A/A controls.

Refresh the absolute performance figures in the README only during a release,
using a recorded, reproducible measurement environment. Ordinary refactors
validate relative performance against their preserved baseline and do not need
to reproduce or update the README's absolute numbers.

```sh
python3 scripts/compare_performance.py \
  --baseline artifacts/refactor/baseline/markview \
  --baseline-revision BASELINE_COMMIT \
  --candidate target/release/markview \
  --output artifacts/refactor/comparison
```

The output directory must be new. By default the script alternates baseline and
candidate order across five groups, using 100 full-layout samples and 100 cached
samples per process, on all four 10 KiB fixtures, the local image example and
the small Emoji fallback fixture.
It preserves individual JSON reports, binary hashes, font inventory hash,
platform/backend metadata, CPU affinity, and a Markdown/JSON comparison. An incompatible
adapter, input, viewport or semantic result fails the comparison.

First-open medians come from independent processes; they are not warm-reflow P95s
and do not flush the OS file cache. The acceptance metrics are first open, full
and cached P50/P95, post-scroll RSS/peak RSS, and tracked GPU bytes. Each uses the
median of its per-process measurements; an increase over 5% fails. Initialization
and individual stage medians remain diagnostic alongside raw samples because
very small stage durations are sensitive to timer and scheduling noise. Missing
memory measurements are reported as unavailable, not a pass. Repeat an unstable
comparison and investigate outliers rather than changing the threshold.
The benchmark also separates `gpu_prepare_and_submit_ms` from `gpu_wait_ms`;
the latter includes blocking driver completion and host scheduling, not just
GPU execution. Both remain included in the original end-to-end timing.

For unexplained P95 failures, first run an A/A control by supplying the same
preserved binary as both sides. A failed A/A gate demonstrates measurement
variability, not a code regression. On hybrid CPUs, compare both versions with
the same affinity (for example, `taskset -c CPU_LIST python3 scripts/compare_performance.py …`
on Linux, after identifying the local core topology). Use `--iterations 500`
or more to increase tail samples. Preserve these runs separately when affinity
or iteration counts differ; do not merge incompatible experiments or relax the
5% gate. A controlled pass does not erase an earlier failed measurement.

Keep visual checks alongside timing checks. Compare deterministic offscreen
exports with the preserved binary, then run the ignored GPU tests and native
window/watch smoke tests. Native Windows/macOS CI checks remain necessary;
Linux GPU measurements do not establish runtime behavior on those platforms.

When a noisy fixture needs additional groups, retain the original groups and
merge them with the follow-up instead of selecting the more favorable run:

```sh
python3 scripts/compare_performance.py \
  --merge artifacts/refactor/acceptance artifacts/refactor/long-code-followup \
  --output artifacts/refactor/combined
```

Merging verifies identical binary hashes, toolchain, fonts, CPU affinity, backend,
profile and iteration counts; it reports the number of groups for each fixture.
