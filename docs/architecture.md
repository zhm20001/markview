# Architecture

This document explains what the major parts of Markview own and why the boundaries exist. It is intended for someone reading the implementation, not for someone trying to add a feature; procedural guidance lives in [the development guide](development.md).

## The three-layer pipeline

Markview is a read-only desktop application organized around a core and two rendering backends:

```text
Markdown / assets
        │
        ▼
markview-core: semantic document → immutable layout snapshot
        │
        ├── markview-render: snapshot → GPU frame
        │
        ├── markview-pdf: snapshot + pages → PDF content streams
        │
        └── markview application: files, settings, input, and lifecycle
```

`markview-core` is window- and GPU-independent. It parses Markdown and the supported raw HTML subset, represents semantic blocks and inline content, shapes text, lays out paragraphs, measures math and images, and exposes reading text, selection geometry, links, and draw instructions.

`markview-render` consumes those instructions. It owns the wgpu device and surface, glyph and image resources, clipping, colors that can be changed without reflow, and headless output. It does not contain a second document layout engine.

`markview-pdf` consumes the same snapshot for paper. It re-lays the document at the page's text measure, breaks the column into pages, and writes vector content through `krilla`: text as glyph runs with subset fonts and a character map, math, rules, boxes, images, and link annotations. It owns no window, no GPU, and no source parsing.

The root package owns effects that must touch the operating system: launching, file and settings I/O, file watching, image loading, clipboard access, platform link opening, window events, and background work. The UI translates gestures into commands; it does not define document semantics.

The separation matters because the same core layout is used by the interactive window, the renderer tests, and the offscreen render and benchmark modes.

## Application feature boundaries

Panel navigation uses one `PanelPage` for closed, settings (general, styles or
fonts), export and export styles. `InteractionState` owns transitions, clears
transient input and preserves parent form offsets on page round trips. The
outline and confirmation remain independent overlays.

`app/font_panel` owns the font catalogue, filters, scroll, download progress,
cancellation and notices, plus its view and typed commands. Chrome borrows one
`View`; the application routes `Command::Fonts` and adapts download messages to
the event loop. The feature receives stylesheet entries, font configuration and
an offline flag instead of borrowing `App`. Font installation still belongs to
`fonts`; only the application updates the reader's font revision after a job
stores files. The CLI adapter uses the same installation service independently.

`net` owns bounded HTTP transport, address validation, redirects and transfer
cancellation. Images own their response-cache and decoding policies; fonts own
archive limits and installation transactions. Neither service obtains transport
through the other.

`export::PdfRequest` contains the source, destination, layout/font options,
page and metadata overrides, links and offline policy. CLI and GUI construct it
independently, preserving their defaults. PDF processing consumes this request
without launch or window state; its watch session retains the existing caches.
PNG scheduling remains in the desktop adapter.

## Semantic identity and immutable snapshots

Parsing produces a `Document` made of blocks and rich inline content. A block keeps its source range for diagnostics and a semantic identity for cache reuse. Source positions are not used as identity: inserting text above a block must not make every later block appear to be a different kind of content.

A reload re-parses the whole file, but a small edit to a document whose top-level blocks are plain leaves separated by blank lines re-parses only the block the edit fell in and reuses the rest, shifting the source ranges of the blocks after it. Documents with containers, code, tables or reference definitions take the full parse, because those can span a blank line or carry meaning outside their own block.

Layout produces an immutable `LayoutSnapshot`. A snapshot contains final geometry, logical reading text, text clusters, link hit regions, overflow information, and drawing instructions. The renderer and interaction code can therefore read the same result without mutating the layout engine or rebuilding text for copying.

The reading index is deliberately separate from glyphs. Grapheme boundaries, shaping clusters, formula ranges, image fallback text, and code whitespace all need a stable logical mapping even when visual layout inserts hyphens, expands tabs, or replaces an unavailable asset with a placeholder. Selection and copying operate on that logical mapping, so reflow changes rectangles but not the meaning of a selection.

## Versions and asynchronous work

The application distinguishes a content version from a request version. A file open or reload changes content; a type-size, column, alignment, or hyphenation change changes only the requested layout. The worker retains the last parsed document and publishes snapshots tagged with both versions.

Only the newest request may be accepted. A late result cannot replace a newer layout, while a reload cannot be lost merely because a reflow request occupied the worker's single pending slot. Failed reads keep the last usable snapshot, because a transient editor save should not blank the reader.

For sources of at least 32 KiB, the window worker publishes completed prefixes after they cover the current
viewport plus half a viewport of prefetch. Parsing still covers the entire source,
so references and other document-wide semantics are resolved before layout starts.
Prefixes and the final snapshot share immutable block geometry; publishing does
not restart layout. Without a new viewport target, subsequent publications need
both twice as many blocks and at least 32 ms since the previous publication, so
copying snapshot metadata does not grow quadratically with document length.
Smaller documents publish once to avoid extra snapshot and redraw overhead;
they still check cancellation between blocks.

Every prefix carries the same request and content versions as the final result.
Cancellation is checked between top-level blocks; changing the file or layout
settings supersedes the old work. The UI checks the version again before accepting
an event. Reload prefixes replace the old snapshot only when they cover its
reading anchor and visible area (and any existing selection); otherwise the old
snapshot remains visible until a sufficient prefix or the final result arrives.
An appended prefix preserves the active selection gesture and scroll position.

Scroll intent is separate from displayed scroll. Repeated PageDown presses
accumulate a target even beyond completed geometry; the worker prioritizes
publishing a prefix that covers that target. The current page stays visible until
the target is available. PageUp reverses the pending target and Home cancels it;
End waits for the final height. The document scrolls until its last line can
sit one third of a page below the top, leaving the rest blank; an end already
higher than that does not scroll. While geometry is incomplete, the footer
shows loading, the document scrollbar is hidden, and Select All waits for
completion.
The implementation does not estimate total height or skip preceding blocks.
One very large top-level paragraph, table, list, or code block can still delay
publication and cancellation until that block finishes.

Images follow the same model. Loading and decoding happen outside layout. A decoded image changes the version of the affected source, causing only dependent blocks to reflow; the document's semantic reading identity, selection, and reading position remain stable.

A remote body is kept in a bounded on-disk cache beside the user configuration, keyed by its absolute URL: it is reused while fresh, revalidated with a conditional request when stale, and served under `--offline` when present. Stored bytes are the fetched bytes, so a cached image decodes exactly like a network one, and the existing byte and pixel caps still apply. The store, the freshness policy, and the single pinned HTTP client are separate modules, all on the image workers.

A stylesheet may also list the font files its families are published as. That is a separate, explicit user action rather than part of reading: `fonts` owns the user font directory, checks each body as a font, renames it into place, and leaves an already-present file alone. When a job stores a file, the application adds the directory to the reader's `FontConfig` and bumps its revision; a job that stored nothing leaves both alone, so a retry of an entirely failed download does not cache another identical collection. Because the revision is part of the layout key and of the collection cache key, the ordinary reflow picks the new faces up without a restart, and that cache keeps only the most recently used configurations rather than one collection per revision forever. Exports shape with the same configuration as the reader's display, so a personal download reaches them too; the measurement runs and `--ignore-system-fonts` keep the set the command line named, so a personal download cannot change reproducible output.

A Mermaid fence is one more source on that path rather than a second pipeline. Parsing turns it into an image whose source carries the diagram text, an image worker renders that text to SVG once per source, and the existing SVG rasterizer decodes it like any other vector image. Layout only ever sees a placeholder or a decoded box, so a malformed diagram becomes the ordinary image error and a document with many diagrams still publishes geometry without waiting for them.

A raw `<details>` block becomes one collapsible block. Comrak ends a type-6 HTML block at a blank line, so the parser gathers the Markdown blocks up to the closing tag and parses the summary as inline content; an unmatched opening or a stray closing tag keeps the old literal fallback. The open state is interaction state rather than document text, carried in the layout options keyed by the block's semantic id, so toggling invalidates only that block's geometry and a collapsed body is never laid out.

## Why layout is separate from painting

Paragraphs are shaped before painting because line breaking needs real glyph advances, language-aware break opportunities, hyphenation, inline formulas, and atomic image boxes. Inline code adds its own rule on top: since it carries no hyphenation dictionary, every character boundary inside a code run is offered as a break — free at a word edge, and at a small penalty inside a word — so a long identifier wraps rather than overflowing. Markview uses a bounded Knuth–Plass-style optimizer for ordinary paragraphs and falls back to legal greedy breaks when a paragraph exceeds the candidate budget or has no valid optimized solution. The fallback protects responsiveness without making invalid breaks. Glyph fallback is frugal the same way: a cluster no configured face covers is drawn from a scan of the font collection's character maps, stopped at the closest style and weight and remembered per cluster, so a rare symbol costs one scan per document; the platform's per-script fallback only hears about clusters nothing installed can draw.

Justification and line breaking share one microtypographic model, in `microtype`. Each shaped cluster carries how far its advance may stretch or shrink, which the optimizer sums into line metrics and the painter spends through a single ratio. Word spaces and a bounded amount of letter spacing are used first; whatever slack is left is then shared evenly over the clusters that can take it, which is what closes a CJK line that has no word spaces. Both bounds are reader settings, so a narrow column can trade even spacing against tighter or looser words.

East Asian punctuation gives back the blank half of its em box at a line start or end, and Han text is spaced a quarter em from Latin, both following the W3C Requirements for Chinese Text Layout. Which half a mark gives up depends on the reader's `cjk-type`, since the mainland, Taiwanese and Japanese conventions place the comma-like marks differently. A closing mark also hangs part of its advance into the end margin, which is what makes a justified line read as flush, and a CJK quotation mark may take the line edge its convention asks for even though UAX #14 forbids a break on either side of one. Because the same numbers drive measurement and painting, a drawn line is the line the optimizer chose.

Page breaking is the one layout step that exists only for paper. `markview-core::paginate` collects each block's drawn lines into bands, records the space each band needs together with the lines widow and orphan control refuses to separate from it, and distributes the bands over fixed-height regions, following the model Typst uses for flow layout. A block owns its whole vertical extent, so a fragment that opens a page starts at the block's top edge while a continuation starts at its first line. The reader never runs this pass.

Math is laid out as an atomic display list and images as atomic inline boxes. This keeps their baseline and height in the line model. Images do not create a float band: text never wraps around their sides. An image-only paragraph is centered and may receive a caption; mixed content remains an inline paragraph.

Painting is consequently a projection of an already-decided layout. Scrolling and selection only change which geometry is visible and which overlays are painted. Theme colors can often be late-bound; font, width, spacing, and other geometry changes require reflow.

## Interaction and platform effects

The application owns focus, hover, selection gestures, scrolling, scrollbar grabs, and modal input: the settings, stylesheet and export panels and the local-file confirmation. Core owns hit testing and selection geometry so those operations remain testable without a window or GPU.

A document reaches the reader from the command line on every desktop. macOS adds the desktop's own handoff: the bundle declares its Markdown document types, so a double-click in Finder, an "Open with" choice, or a file dropped on the app's icon launches it with an open-documents Apple Event that carries one file URL per document. `src/app/open_document.rs` answers that event and forwards each file to the event loop as the `Event::Open` a command-line argument already produces, so a document the desktop opens and one typed on the command line reach the same tab-opening path, and every file of one event becomes its own tab. The handler is taken from the launch notification rather than from the application delegate, which `winit` owns, and it has to be taken at that moment: AppKit installs its own document handler while launching, so a registration made earlier is replaced and one made later never sees the event that is already pending.

A wheel gesture's axis is decided once, from its first few moments of motion, and held until the gesture ends: sideways pans the wide block under the pointer, vertical scrolls the document. Deciding per event instead would make a diagonal gesture stutter, because an event that leans sideways pans or, over no wide block, does nothing at all while the page stops following the hand. The motion that decides the axis is held and applied with the deciding event, and a gesture inherits nothing from the one before it: a boundary the platform reports, or a pause where it reports none, ends the gesture. A sideways gesture over no wide block still scrolls the page by the vertical motion it carries, rather than being dropped; one that is purely sideways has no target and no vertical motion to apply.

A wheel event arrives as either a line delta or a pixel delta, and each desktop scales differently. A line is one wheel detent on X11 and Wayland, where the desktop's own speed setting never reaches the event, so it counts as the conventional three lines; on Windows the desktop's lines- and characters-per-notch choices are read once with `SystemParametersInfoW` and multiply their own axis, with "a page at a time" becoming the viewport along that axis. macOS bakes its speed and acceleration into the deltas it delivers, and reports the resulting lines, so nothing there is multiplied. A pixel delta — a touchpad on macOS or Wayland — is physical and is turned back into logical pixels with the display scale. The reader's own scroll-speed multiplier, 0.5× to 2× in quarter steps, then scales every wheel request and arrow step; it is the only handle where the platform reports no system value at all.

A discrete scroll request — Page Up/Down or Space, Home/End, the arrow steps, a click on the scrollbar track, and an anchor jump — eases to its destination. The motion is ease-out cubic over 120–400 ms scaled by distance and driven by elapsed time, so it does not depend on the frame rate. The animation's destination is the session's pending scroll, so the worker still chases it and a press that arrives before the geometry does accumulates from the destination rather than the displayed offset; the displayed offset is clamped to the geometry at hand, so an unreachable destination never shows blank space and resolves when layout catches up. Wheel and touchpad motion eases the same way and joins the pending destination while it continues the motion, while a gesture that runs against it takes over from the displayed offset instead, so reversing it answers the hand at once rather than finishing the old destination first. A wheel that reports fractional detents is a high-resolution device instead, and Windows gives a touchpad's inertia to such a reader as a few large packets, each landing a quarter of a second after the motion it describes; easing those from a standstill would make a fast two-finger scroll crawl and then lurch, so the stream carries a speed taken from the spacing of its packets, the page rides that speed across the gaps between them, and a packet whose distance the page has already run past is spent as it arrives. A thumb drag is never eased, and ends a running animation, as do tab switches, reloads, panels and confirmations. A request with no distance to travel creates no animation state, no timer is armed and the event loop waits as before.

While the reader stays put, the renderer rasterizes the glyphs of the screenful below in slices of a couple of milliseconds, so the frame that scrolls into them does not pay for them. A pass yields to any frame that is itself slow, declines once the glyph atlas is three quarters full rather than evicting what is on screen, and stops once the screenful is prepared. It leaves image demand and image textures to the frame that is actually presented: the frame it builds is thrown away, so publishing its demand would drop the request for an image the reader can see.

Links are activated only on a matching, non-drag release. `src/link.rs` is the single policy for what a document-controlled link may do: Markdown opens as a reader tab, an inert allowlist of files and any directory goes to the system handler, and everything else is shown in a confirmation first, whose default action opens the containing folder. [Security and threat model](security.md#links-and-os-handlers) owns the policy and residual risks; the [security reference](security-reference.md#local-link-classification) lists the exact extensions. A document that names more remote images than the per-revision cap allows shows a notice strip below the tab bar with Dismiss and Load all; the strip reserves its own band rather than covering text. A heading fragment moves the reader to that heading: `#anchor` inside the current document, or `file.md#anchor` after the target tab opens. Anchors are the GitHub slugs of heading text, and a link that uses a different slug rule is reported as a missing heading rather than guessed at. Markdown is never opened for writing. Clipboard output is reading text: code preserves meaningful whitespace, tables use tabs, formulas contribute LaTeX, and Markdown markers are omitted.

A table-of-contents drawer lists a document's headings in reading order, built once per accepted document and cached with the session. It is an overlay rather than a modal panel: `PanelPage` remains closed, so the document keeps scrolling and selecting behind it, while the wheel over the drawer, the drawer's own rows, and Up/Down while it is open belong to the list. An entry jumps through the same fragment path as a `#anchor` link, and the entry holding the reading position is highlighted from the snapshot's heading anchors, resolved only while the drawer is open.

Settings are layered as defaults, user TOML, then explicit command-line overrides. Interactive changes may persist user preferences; render, benchmark, and smoke modes never read the user's TOML, so a preference set in the window does not reach their output. Stylesheets are parsed and merged transactionally: an invalid update leaves the last effective stylesheet in place.

## Resource and performance boundaries

The practical performance boundary is not a promise about every Markdown file. Ordinary paragraphs have a line-break budget, image decoding has byte and pixel caps, and CPU image pixels and GPU textures have independent budgets. Caches are bounded or scoped to the current document where possible.

Measured baselines and their environment live in the [performance model](performance.md). Compare like-for-like runs: fonts, drivers, DPI, pathological paragraphs and large assets all affect the result.

## Internal ownership

The package boundaries also apply inside each crate. Entry points compose concrete
components; helpers receive borrowed inputs instead of an application-wide context.

| Component | Owns | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application `Tabs` | Active session, inactive tabs, request serial | Tab transitions return to the window adapter for watching, redraws and requests. |
| Application `Preferences` | Effective settings, persistence store, stylesheet catalog, save deadline | Stylesheet validation finishes before the effective sheet and UI appearance change. The application applies successful changes to the renderer. Export preferences live beside the reader's, never inside them. |
| Application export | One export's settings, its background job, the PNG strip loop and the watch target | Reads and lays the document out itself at the export's own options, so it never requests a reader layout; only PNG strips touch the shared GPU device, one per frame, with the export's own stylesheet. |
| Application tab strip | Scroll offset, drag gesture and cached filename widths | Pure strip geometry drives both painting and hit testing. Reordering moves sessions without submitting layout requests; clipped draw groups contain overflow. |
| Application chrome | Borrowed display state and compiled icon buffers | Controls, footer, tabs and styles produce geometry without window, worker or configuration I/O access. Shared buttons and grouped forms own drawing, clipped pointer regions and focus geometry; font scroll and filters stay in the font feature; other panel offsets stay in interaction state. Selection-count caching remains in the application adapter; icons stay editable SVG files that the `markview-icon` macro parses into vector buffers at compile time, so no SVG parser reaches the binary. |
| Image scheduler | Versioned entries, jobs and published snapshot | Source reads, the pinned HTTP client, the bounded disk cache, bounded decoding and allocation-aware pixel eviction are separate modules. |
| `LayoutEngine` | Document block cache, shaping/math resources, highlight owner | Snapshot assembly and invalidation stay at this entry point; immutable stylesheet identity is computed once per document pass. |
| `paginate` | Band segmentation, page distribution, page furniture | Pure geometry over a settled snapshot: no fonts, no I/O, and no effect on the reader's layout. |
| PDF painter | Font subsets, glyph runs, page content, annotations | One export owns its krilla document; nothing it embeds outlives the call. |
| Block layout context | Borrowed shaper, math engine, image snapshot and completed highlights | Inline preparation, paragraphs, code, images, tables and containers cannot start jobs or invalidate document caches. |
| Renderer `Gpu` | Device, queue, surface and device-loss state | Owns acquisition, resize/recovery, completion and offscreen readback. |
| Renderer raster cache | Atlas, raster keys, scaler and math fonts | Glyph/path preparation borrows the queue; paths write to the shared geometry buffer. |
| Renderer image textures | Texture cache, image runs and current-frame demand | Owns budget checks, version pruning and atomic demand publication. |
| Renderer geometry | Vertices and reusable GPU vertex storage | Produces clipped quads; the frame adapter preserves paint order and submission. |

Parsing and representation have separate source modules: Markdown translation
owns the comrak reader, settings persistence owns the serialized configuration,
and stylesheet parsing owns validation. Reading selection and visual hit testing
share the immutable text nodes without rebuilding their logical content.

Module extraction does not change line-break budgets, cache keys, worker counts,
image budgets, request acceptance, or ordering of draw commands. Hot paths use
concrete types and borrowed resources, with no dispatch registry or additional
synchronization. A source-file target of about 500 production lines is a review
heuristic, not a reason to split an otherwise cohesive algorithm. Tests live next
to their owning modules in separate sources when they obscure production code.
`scene.rs` remains a small exception at about 530 lines: it keeps the shared
immutable drawing, viewport and scrollbar geometry vocabulary together.

### Touch and touchpad gestures

`app::gestures` owns gesture capture and routes motion to the document, a wide
block, Contents, a settings panel or the tab strip. The pure `recognizer` handles
contact identity, tap slop, direction locking and velocity decay;
it does not depend on window creation, layout workers or renderer state. A tap
activates only on release over its original target. A drag or additional finger
cancels that activation. Touch controls accept at least a 44-logical-pixel hit
area where space permits, with exact hits taking priority over nearby controls.

Touch motion follows the finger without wheel-speed scaling. Pixel-based
trackpad motion uses the configured scroll multiplier but bypasses wheel easing.
Both inputs capture their scrolling surface and share exponential coasting,
stopping at bounds or on new input, navigation, focus loss, resize and reload.
macOS pixel events include native momentum, so Markview does not synthesize a
second coast. Other pixel streams can coast when the backend supplies an `Ended`
phase. Streams without an end phase retain their delivered motion; line events
take the wheel path, where a Windows touchpad's fractional stream is a
high-resolution device whose spacing gives the reader the momentum to ride.

Touch and native `PinchGesture` zoom are pending viewport-based zoom support;
pinching does not currently change document settings. Generated mouse events
are suppressed while touching and briefly after release.
