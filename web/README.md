# Markview Web components

Start with [the MVaaC component guide](../docs/mvaac.md) for package ownership,
quick start, editor/viewer APIs, resource injection, deployment and migration.
[Source navigation and TOC](../docs/mvaac-source-api.md) defines UTF-16 offsets,
document versions, geometry and scrolling behavior. The
[initial demo contract](../docs/mvaac-web-demo.md) is preserved as historical
reference; its scope exclusions do not apply to the reusable components.

## Workspace

- `packages/markview`: `@markview/viewer`, including sibling WASM asset.
- `packages/editor`: `@markview/editor`, CodeMirror and preview composition.
- `packages/scroll-sync`: `@markview/scroll-sync`, editor-independent anchor projection and scroll coordination.
- `packages/fonts`: optional `@markview/fonts` explicit loading/cache.
- `packages/resources`: optional `@markview/resources` browser transport.
- `packages/web`: deprecated `@markview/web` compatibility entry.
- `apps/demo`: one reading/editing SPA at `/index.html`, with shared source, history, and reading position.
- `/editor.html` redirects to `/index.html#edit` for existing links.
- `tests/fixtures/reader`: legacy renderer regression host, built only by `pnpm test`.

Official WASM enables WOFF/WOFF2; hosts explicitly supply per-instance font sets.
The SPA loads version-pinned Noto Latin, Simplified Chinese and emoji fonts from
jsDelivr, using Fontsource WOFF2 for Latin and common Simplified Chinese text.
Full CJK monospace OTF and bitmap emoji TTF remain upstream files. The first
load needs network access; successful font downloads persist in Cache Storage
for subsequent reloads, with ordinary downloads if storage is unavailable.
Test font subsets are used only
by the regression harness.

## Build and validate

Install Node.js 22+, pnpm, Python 3.11+ and [Rust via rustup](https://rustup.rs).
From the repository root, the same commands work in Windows shells, macOS and Linux:

```sh
pnpm --dir web install
pnpm --dir web run setup
pnpm --dir web build
pnpm --dir web serve
```

`setup` prepares the browser target and matching bindings tool automatically.
Use `pnpm --dir web build:ts` for subsequent TypeScript-only changes and reload
the page. `build` includes an incremental WASM build; `build:wasm` rebuilds only
the engine. See [build and test](../docs/mvaac.md#build-and-test) for prerequisites,
generated directories and advanced tool/output-path configuration.

To validate a build:

```sh
pnpm --dir web typecheck
pnpm --dir web exec playwright install chromium
pnpm --dir web test
pnpm --dir web test:packages
```

Build examples and tests consume package `dist` entries rather than source
aliases. The static site is `web/dist`. Serve it through HTTP, not `file:`.
WASM is copied under `markview_web_bg.wasm`; downstream bundlers can import the
`@markview/viewer/wasm` asset or provide its deployed URL explicitly.

Use `MV_GPU=1 pnpm --dir web test --project=chromium-gpu` for the opt-in Vulkan
browser project. Default browser tests use SwiftShader. Native engine tests run
with `cargo test -p markview-core`; WASM lint runs with
`cargo clippy -p markview-web --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --features woff -- -D warnings`.
